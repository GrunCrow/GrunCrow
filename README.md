### Hey, I'm GrunCrow ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working in [BIRDeep](https://github.com/BIRDeepORG) and [SEANIMALMOVE](https://github.com/SEANIMALMOVE), the public repository you can see related to it is [BIRDeep - Audio Detection and Classification](https://github.com/GrunCrow/BIRDeep_NeuralNetworks) and the [Github Organization SEANIMALMOVE](https://github.com/SEANIMALMOVE).
- ðŸ“– Latest publication: [A Bird Song Detector for improving bird identification through Deep Learning: a case study from DoÃ±ana](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2025.103254), check code in [BIRDeep Bird Song Detector](https://github.com/GrunCrow/BIRDeep_BirdSongDetector_NeuralNetworks)
- ðŸŽ“ All my University Code is available at [UHU-Code](https://github.com/GrunCrow/UHU_Code) for the Computer Science Bachelor and at [UCO-MUICE](https://github.com/GrunCrow/MUICE) for the Computational Intelligence and IoT Master.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning different AI approaches in Python, I would love to work more on Deep Learning tecniques applied to ecology and environment conservation
